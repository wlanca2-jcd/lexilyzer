The syntax
----------

Program  =  "program"  Identifier  ":"  Body  "end" .

Comments:
--------

0.  Integer literals and identifiers are treated as terminal symbols.

1.  White space is allowed anywhere, except within terminal symbols.

1.  A comment begins with a double slash ("//") and terminates at the end of
    the line.

2.  "Maximum munch" applies. For example, "if1" is an identifier, not an "if"
    followed by a "1".

3.  The scope of a variable is from its declaration to the end of the nearest
    enclosing body.  Standard rules for hiding apply.
